excerpt: 'Business proposal for Single Sign for a healthcare company'

---

he purpose of this paper is to recommend that Adams Healthcare institute a Single Sign On
(SSO) Service. Adams Healthcare is a growing healthcare clinic where an employee uses on average fifteen individual applications and services in one day, each with unique usernames and passwords. In the past year Adams Healthcare has seen a 30% growth of calls to the helpdesk surrounding passwords, an impact that is causing both excess budget expenses and employee frustration. The proposed implementation of a SAML Integrated SSO is analyzed through the lens of the CIA Security triangle, taking time to consider the security risks and benefits of the system. Through this exploration it is clear that a Single Sign On implementation will create a homogenized and improved user flow and is a valuable addition to Adams Healthcare.
