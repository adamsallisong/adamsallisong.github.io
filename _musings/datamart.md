Data tools that provide visualization enable businesses to generate visuals that go beyond the standard data presentation and offer a “spark” of excitement when highlighting data trends and results. These trends help to identify trends that can be traced to either causation of problems, or deliver a solution to issues a company is currently facing. These visualizations help to turn data from simply a spreadsheet of numbers into insights that can be held, 	and applied to real world business problems offering a competitive advantage.

Powerful data visualization tools offer a way to integrate several datasets into one comprehensive dashboard and story. In Tableau, this was incredibly important while conducting research for my visualization project. I had several data sources that were all from the ERS, but wanted to display how trends played off of each other. Through smart “joins” within the data tool I was able to easily import the data and combine them into one visualization. Additionally, in the realm of big data the data types can vary between structured and unstructured data. Since these tools can read a variety of data inputs from JSON, API, Excel, Text Files, CSV within one workbook companies are empowered to “never say no” to data, and visually explore trends that might have previously been ignored or inaccessible.

The visualization tools go beyond the basics of Excel Charting features because they provide GUI tools to access large amounts of data in a consumable and reusable way. This concept of reusability is key, especially for large corporations that need to compare several facts against a similar measure. One example of this is through a parameter. These parameters allow for a mathematical “if statement” to be applied to calculated measures and provide the end user to easily interact with the data. Another feature that goes beyond basic Excel functionality is the “Story” or “Motion” Feature of Tableau. This feature allows for the user to create a basic animation highlighting a trend.


This is not to say that these functionalities do not exist or are possible within Excel. However, in Excel these functionalities are hidden among pivot tables or macros, and require an in-depth knowledge of excel development or VBA. Common pain points of Excel, such as merged cells or poorly formatted tables are resolved through built in Tableau functionalities such as the data interpreter. Modern day tools empower end users through easy to use GUI and drag and drop allowing for the creation of visualizations that can quickly provide real business value without in depth knowledge of data management.
