# h1 Hadoop & MapReduce Configuration & Tutorial
## What is Hadoop?
Hadoop is an open source platform that expedites the processing & analysis of large data (both
structured and unstructured) in a distributed computing environment. Hadoop is comprised of
two fundamental components:
### Distributed File System
This is the file structure of Hadoop that is set across several
computer nodes (datanodes, slave nodes) to help process large amounts of data. The hdfs can
be accessed by several different clients as if they were one local client. 
### MapReduce
This algorithm allows for queries to be processed in parallel as opposed to the
traditional serial fashion through distributed applications. The map function will take a
function and apply it to each subsequent value in the dataset. The reduce function then takes
the separate data nodes (master/slave relationship) that will process an individual query and 
process results in tandem. These key value pairs are then aggregated together and returned to
the name node
